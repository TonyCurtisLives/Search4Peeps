# Search4Peeps

### A fun and exciting adventure in Monty Python personalities, particularly related to the lovely film "Monty Python and the Holy Grail".

#### Using Visual Studio Express 2015

#### With the project option "ASP.NET Web Application (.NET Framework)"

##### Also With 

* C#
* MVC
* Entity Framework
* SQL Server Express 2016 LocalDB **(make sure you have Express 2016 local db installed https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=799012 and on install select localDb option)**

##### Including

* Unity
* A little JavaScript
* Some CSS
* MS Test
* Moq


**Parents Strongly Cautioned: There are some scenes of violence, though it is 
fanciful, and not very realistic.**

*Note: Initially I made the model with 3 tables. I separated the address data 
since that has been a convention for me for many years. I also separated the 
photo data since I was storing the image in the database and it makes performance
better. In hindsight it would have been a cinch to implement the creation 
functionality had I used a simple design, but I didn't, and did not have time
to finish up the creation functionality. But the table is fully seeded, and I 
think the seeded data is delightful and full of fond memories that I hope you 
can enjoy!*
